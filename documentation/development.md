You dig patternplate-client and want to submit a pull request? Awesome!
Be sure to read the [contribution guide](./contributing.md) and you should be good to go.
Here are some notes to get you coding real quick.

### Prerequesites
For development for patternplate-client you'll need:
* **All systems**: git
* **Windows**: node/io `4`
* **Unix(ish)**: node/io `4, 3, 2, 1`

### Getting started
Fetch, install and start the default watch task
```
git clone https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate-client.git
cd patternplate-client
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
This will watch all files in `source` and start the appropriate tasks when changes are detected.

### Build system
patternplate-client is written using ES6 and ES7 features and transpiled to ES5 compatible code.

* All js sources are kept in `source` and built to `distribution/`.
  **NOTE** `distribution/` is ignored from SCM and only included when releasing to npm
* Documentation templates are kept in `source` with an extension of `.tpl` and built to `.`
* gulp is used as task manager. List available tasks via `npm run gulp help`
* A [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) is provided. Make sure to use the applicable plugin for your editor.
* A [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) is provided. The default build will fail when linting fails. To make your life easier you can install the eslint plugin applicable for your editor.
* patternplate-client uses commitizen to make adherence to the [commit rules](../contributing.md#commit-rules) easier. Use `npm run commit` to commit changes.
* All dependencies are pinned to specific versions and managed via [greenkeeper](/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper).
* [package.json](../package.json) does not include a version field. Releases to npm are managed via [semantic-release](/semantic-release/semantic-release)
